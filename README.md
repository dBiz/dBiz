Here's my collection of modules for VCVRack! 
Many thx to Michael Hetrick, Strum's Mental and Jeremy Wen for sources and inspiring me!
Ready for v 0.5 here's what i have:

- Quad envelope generator based on rampage,
- Utility transposer octave/sem/fine with ability to link the inputs,
-Performance 8 channel stereo mixer with stereo sends and return
- VCA based on Roland VCA530

Those are basically a reskinned version of some Strum modules, but i splitted cartesian sequencer in case you don't need the pad/keyboard
