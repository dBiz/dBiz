GRID SEQUENCERS 

Starting from some grid sequencers like Cartesian by strum and Gridseq by JW i've made those grid sequencers:

- Bene
Classical 4x4 cv sequencer with internal quantization , 
  BenePads is his "keyboard" it sends position to Bene(x,y) and a Gate out(g);

- Bene2
 Evolution of Bene: Can out up to 8 individual sequence with cv (colums and rows) and gate (on the bottom) outs running with independent cloks. still some fix to do as usuall but it's really fun to play with it!

OSCILLATORS:

They don't need introductions ;)
