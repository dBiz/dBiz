Here's my collection of modules for VCVRack! 
Many thx to Michael Hetrick, Strum's Mental and Jeremy Wen for sources and inspiring me!
Ready for v 0.5 here's what i have:

- Quad envelope generator based on rampage,
- Utility transposer octave/sem/fine with ability to link the inputs,
- Performance 8 channel stereo mixer with stereo sends and return
- VCA based on Roland VCA530

Based on Strum modules i've made a compact 4 channel mixer, a 8 channel mixer,a chord utility and from Michael Hetrick Scanner i've made Remix Module !

Starting from some grid sequencers like Cartesian by strum and Gridseq by JW i've made those grid sequencers:

- Bene
Classical 4x4 cv sequencer with internal quantization , 
  BenePads is his "keyboard" it sends position to Bene(x,y) and a Gate out(g);

- Bene2
 Evolution of Bene: Can out up to 8 individual sequence with cv (colums and rows) and gate (on the bottom) outs running with independent cloks. still some fix to do as usuall but it's really fun to play with it!

And here's a collection of oscillator you might know...
